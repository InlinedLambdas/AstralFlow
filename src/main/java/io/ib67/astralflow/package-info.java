/**

 * Before diving into AstralFlow, You should mention that there're many `Simple` or `XXImpl` classes.<br />
 * Generally, these classes are for internal use only and you're not supposed to use them due to not clearly defined behaviours.<br />
 * Always use these abstract classes (or interfaces), have fun!<br />
