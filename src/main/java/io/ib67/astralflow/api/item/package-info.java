 * Here are some presets for the Item API. You can use these components to create some common items (such as ingredients) quickly.<br />
 * <p/><br />
 * A usual case is to create a new item with dummy first, then set states for them in the future (but you will have to do some migration like {@link io.ib67.astralflow.manager.ItemRegistry#saveState(org.bukkit.inventory.ItemStack, io.ib67.astralflow.item.StateScope, io.ib67.astralflow.item.ItemState)})
